# Overview

{I created this so that I could get a better understanding of how to make databases that work together and also so I could gain more practice with cloud databases}

{The software I made is a music manager that allows you to create a user and it allows that user to create a playlist and save songs to each specific playlist that the user wants to use.}

{I created this to gain a better understanding and to also gain more experience with cloud databases}

# Cloud Database

{I am using a mongodb database that takes what the user says and saves it in it's database

The way it works is the user will send a command through the url and the url will capture what was sent and send it back to the database to create what the user said if everything is the way it is supposed to be. }

# Development Environment

{I used mongo db docs website to see how to initiate the database}

{I used javascript and also installed node and express and used mongodb's specific libraries.}
